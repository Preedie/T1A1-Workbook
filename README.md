## Question 1:


### Concepts of Markup Languages

The main function and concept for a Markup Language is to take data given, not only by a user (Web Developer) but also by a remote or local source and then display that information onto the internet in the form of a easy to read and navigate webpage. In short the data can be textual or images maybe even video and audio, or in most cases now a days all of the above with the inclusion of so much more.  

### HTML 

or Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language used to insert the "actual" content for a webpage to display. HTML does this by having a user (web developer, or that one person who can seemily do everything without ever learning) write in content using special syntax (computer speak) that the Markup Language understands and can then interpret and display on a webpage.

### CSS 

Or Cascading stylesheet is also a markup language however CSS is used to make the content displayed through HTML look better. In short CSS deals with the design layout and style aspects of the webpage and HTML deals with the content and even some processes that the intended user won't see.

### Accessibility 

In web design is also a important component allowing for a screen reader (through using semantic tags) to interpret the information on the page and present it to the user aswell as allowing for the user to use their keyboard to navigate said website if required.

### Search Engine Optimization

Lastly we as the Web Designer can use techniques to increase our traffic on the website via Search Engine Optimization. Which through the use of meta tags and semantic tags can give the remote host the information required to display the inner content of the webpage being searched for to the user (local computer/tablet etc). Semantic tags aswell as providing user aids can also help give the content in the page importance or "hirarchy" so to speak, if its wrtten correctly which in turn can improve our pages search engine rankings.
