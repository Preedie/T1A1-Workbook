## Question 1:

HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language used to insert the "actual" content for a webpage to display. HTML does this by having a user (web developer, or that one person who can seemily do everything without ever learning) write in content using special syntax (computer speak) that the Markup Language understands and can then interpret and display on a webpage.

CSS or Cascading stylesheet is also a markup language however CSS is used to make the content displayed through HTML look better. In short CSS deals with the design layout and style aspects of the webpage and HTML deals with the content and even some processes that the intended user won't see.
