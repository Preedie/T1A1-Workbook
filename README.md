## Question 1:


### Concepts of Markup Languages

### What is it? 
#### "Put simply"

The main function and concepts for Markup Languages in web development is to act as a tool to take data given by a user (Web Developer) and then display that information onto the internet in a easy to read and structured layout using said languages.

### HTML: 

or Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language used to insert the "actual" content for a webpage to display. HTML does this by having a user (web developer, or that one person who can seemily do everything without ever learning) write in content using special syntax (computer speak) that the Markup Language understands and can then interpret and display on a webpage.

### CSS: 

Or Cascading stylesheet, is also a markup language however CSS is used to make the content displayed through HTML look better. So to expand on "better" CSS deals with the design layout and style aspects of the webpage, taking that barebones frame HTML makes and then improving on it to look more structured aswell as smoother to navigate.

### Accessibility: 

Accessability in web design is also a important component allowing for a screen reader (through using semantic tags) to interpret the information on the page and present it to the user. Proper and well done semantic tagging can allow for the user to navigate through the use of their keyboard, visually or through the use of audio.

### Search Engine Optimization:

Lastly we as the Web Designer can use techniques to increase our traffic on the website via Search Engine Optimization. Which through the use of meta tags and semantic tags can give the remote host the information required to display the content of the webpage being searched for to the user (local computer/tablet etc) but at a higher rate than a webpage without. Semantic tags aswell as providing user aids can also help give the content in the page importance or "hirarchy" so to speak, if its wrtten correctly which in turn can improve our pages search engine rankings thus improving traffic to said website.
